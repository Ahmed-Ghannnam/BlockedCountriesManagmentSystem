# Blocked Countries API

A .NET Core Web API to manage blocked countries and validate IP addresses using third-party geolocation APIs (ipapi.co or IPGeolocation.io). The API stores data in-memory and supports permanent and temporary country blocks, IP lookups, and logs blocked IP attempts.

---

## Features

- Add or remove permanently blocked countries
- Temporarily block countries for a specified duration with automatic expiry
- Lookup country information by IP address (supports caller IP auto-detection)
- Check if callerâ€™s IP is blocked based on country
- Paginated, searchable listing of blocked countries and blocked attempts logs
- Thread-safe in-memory storage with `ConcurrentDictionary` and `List`
- Background service for removing expired temporary blocks
- Clean separation of concerns (services, controllers, models)
- Swagger-based API documentation and testing UI

---

## Tech Stack

- [.NET Core 7/8/9 Web API](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/)
- `HttpClient` with async/await for external API calls
- `ConcurrentDictionary` for thread-safe in-memory data
- [Swagger / Swashbuckle](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore) for API docs
- Newtonsoft.Json for JSON parsing (optional)

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK 7.0 or later](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
- API key from [ipapi.co](https://ipapi.co/) or [IPGeolocation.io](https://ipgeolocation.io/)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BlockedCountriesAPI.git
   cd BlockedCountriesAPI


2. Add your API key to appsettings.json:

{
  "GeoApi": {
   "BaseUrl": "https://api.ipgeolocation.io/ipgeo",
    "ApiKey": "a6d28a71143541f89d1b8dd5e35732cc"
  }
}

4. Build and run the API:

dotnet build
dotnet run

5. Open Swagger UI in your browser for interactive API docs and testing:

https://localhost:{port}/swagger
